title:  Welcome to new world!

The most frustrating thing for me was when my computer motherboard burnt out, and there was no place for repairs in Davis. I had no choice but to buy another computer here. Most of my files can be recovered, but I lost my previous blog files, and the backup was on my lab computer. I won't be able to go back for two months, so I plan to rebuild my blog.ðŸ˜”

Next, I will continue to update this blog, including the notes on CSAPP and Data structures that I have been wanting to update since last year, as well as the notes on Computer Organization and Design for this semester. Afterward, I will focus on research and applying for a Ph.D. program in ECE in the United States. I will also share my CV and information with everyone.ðŸ˜„
